# 2023AntibodyDataAnalysis

Contains the code and data for the analysis of antigen-antibody and general protein interactivity.

Note, please open the code in a code editor which limits output length because some cell outputs are quite long (the warnings do not affect the functionality of the program). 

You can run the cells in sequence starting from part1 and going to part5, some cells may take 10 minutes to run on a typical PC. Model training takes longer of course. If you try to run some cells again where a new directory is created, delete that folder manually and then it will be possible to run the cell. 

Pip install modules required: numpy, biopython, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, keras, scikit-learn, tensorflow, pydot, graphviz. Ensure that you download graphviz on your computer and add to path. Also, enable long paths.
